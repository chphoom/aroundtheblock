# Around the Block
This project was made for COMP 590: User Interfaces at UNC by Keaw, Elaine, and Liya.

Currently in Sprint 1 of development.

## Stories implemented in Sprint 1

- As an artist, I want to view the current global challenge so that I can decide if I want to do it or not.
- As an artist, I want to generate my own challenges so that I can have a prompt that suits my interests.
- As an artist, I want to upload my work so that I can show my interpretation of a challenge.
- As an artist, I want to learn more about this website so that I can understand it better.
- As an artist, I want to see what others have worked on so that I can gain inspiration for my own art.

## Stories implemented in Spring 2
- As a beginner artist, I want to post my work privately so that I can keep my art somewhere even though I don't want others to see it yet.
- As an artist, I want to save challenges so that I can go back to them later.

## Future stories
- As an artist, I want to search through all the art on the website and filter by tags so that I can find works that are relevant to me.
- As an artist, I want to comment on other people's works so that I can provide constructive criticism.
